Add support for:
    - Entering custom image sizes (use transforms() or modify network layers)
    - Resuming training from checkpoint/transfer learning
    - SSIM could be an important metric, implement as a loss function

- Isolate 5 best and 5 worst examples during evaluation
    (If testing more than 10 images)

- Upload more sophisticated architectures

- Test on larger datasets (10k, 20k, ..., 85k source-target pairs)

- Upload small example dataset
