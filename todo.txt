Add support for:
    - Entering custom image sizes (use transforms() or modify network layers)
    - Resuming training from checkpoint/transfer learning
    - SSIM could be an important metric, implement as a loss function

- Isolate 5 best and 5 worst examples during evaluation
    (If testing more than 10 images)

- Account for different ranges for each source spectrogram?
    - Need to find a way to normalise raw data based on changing colormap range..?

- More sophisticated architectures
    - different location of bottleneck? Multiple bottlenecks with skip connections?
    - Multiple scalings for convolution (i.e. split off into 3*3, 5*5, 7*7, 9*9 kernels --> concatenate back together)
